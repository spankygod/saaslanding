# 🎨 Shadcn UI Style Guide  
*A Cinematic, Calm & Premium UI Direction*

This project uses **@shadcn/ui** as the core UI library. Components should feel cinematic, soft, elegant, and emotionally expressive — inspired by visuals like an explorer in a glowing flower field: calm gradients, depth through blur, subtle motion, and refined typography.

---

## 🌌 Visual Philosophy

- Soft, clean, minimalist interfaces  
- Ambient depth using **blur + opacity** instead of heavy shadows  
- Generous whitespace and breathable layouts  
- Rounded edges (`rounded-lg` to `rounded-2xl`) for a gentle feel  
- Color accents should be muted, pastel, or glowing — not harsh  
- Typography should feel premium, calm, and expressive

Think: **cinematic | reflective | emotional | creative**

## 📁 Component Location

Shadcn components live here:

Use alias-based imports:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent, CardFooter } from "@/components/ui/card"
